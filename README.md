# Alex Personal website
A simple personal website written using Flask.

# Goals
- Show skills in full-stack web development using a simple, maintainable framework.
- Learn about DevOps, particularly in deployment, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, etc.
- Improve front-end development skills, especially with using tailwind CSS or bootstrap.
- Consider how best to structure or architect a back-end.
- Play around with different types of persistent storage options.
- Look into containerisation and Orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Deploy to the cloud in a micro instance, use an SBC if I end up getting one to keep costs low.

This is a lot to start with, I'm going to start slow and build up later when I have more time.
